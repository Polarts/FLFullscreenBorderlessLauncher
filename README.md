# Freelancer Fullscreen Borderless Launcher
An attempt to develop a launcher to make Freelancer playable in fullscreen borderless mode.

This is the first in a series of experiments I want to commence.
The goal is to wrap a software layer around Freelancer to enable runtime manipulations and extension of the game's capabilities.
