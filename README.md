# Freelancer Fullscreen Borderless Launcher
An attempt to develop a launcher to make Freelancer playable in fullscreen borderless mode.

This is the first in a series of experiments I want to commence.
The goal is to wrap a software layer around Freelancer to enable runtime manipulations and extension of the game's capabilities.

This project utilized and extends [Erxin](https://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=9435029)'s [WPF AppControl](https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/673701/Hosting-EXE-Applications-in-a-WPF-Window-Applicati) to contain Freelancer within a WPF window.

### Contributions welcome!
